Contributing or modifying:

This mod is not currently looking for contributors, however, due to its nature as an open source creative commons project, nothing can stop you from taking it and creating your own variant (and that's also putting aside translations, which obviously have an interest in diving into the files). Here are a couple useful pointers:
 * If you simply wish to modify text, everything you're looking for is stored in the /i18n folder
 * If you want to create new lines, you will need to add it both to the character's json and /i18n/default.json. Everything has been documented in comments to the best of my ability: which custom lines already exist in the vanilla game, which item numbers map to what, how more complex lines work. Notable exception: no list of "vanilla lines" mentions Stardrop Tea, as *all* characters have a customized reaction to it. It didn't feel worth mentioning everywhere.
