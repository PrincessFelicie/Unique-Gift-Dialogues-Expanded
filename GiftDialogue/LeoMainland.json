/*Vanilla Leo uses different dialogue sheets depending on whether he's reached the valley or not. Which is great! It means
I can have this sheet have his 'wild' speech, then edit the second for once he becomes one of Penny's students.
This version of Leo's dialogue sheet has no AcceptGift line, outside of Stardrop Tea, like everyone.
He has no lines for birthday presents.*/
