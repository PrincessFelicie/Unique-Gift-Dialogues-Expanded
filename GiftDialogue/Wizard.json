/*Vanilla Wizard has no extra lines outside stardrop tea.
SVE also gives him a few gift lines: Void Essence, Purple Mushrooms, and a couple SVE items that aren't relevant here. Still, worth noting, since this is a popular mod.
He has no lines for birthday presents. SVE doesn't change that.
Last verified Vanilla: 1.6.14
Last verified SVE: 1.6.4 or so*/
