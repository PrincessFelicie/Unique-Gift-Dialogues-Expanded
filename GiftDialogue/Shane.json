If any player has seen Shane's 6 heart event, this should cancel out the friendship gain and refund the beer. (I'd like to take birthday into account, but I'm pretty sure the birthday line takes precedence... guess he's allowed a beer on that specific day) Else, a different line depending on whether Shane is currently at the saloon or not.
      I can't get this line to play well without the game crashing... I think stardew doesn't know how to interpret the nested $queries. Slightly less complex, crashless version below.*/
