/*Vanilla Penny has lines for positively-received "ancient items" (a specific set of artifacts tagged with ContextTags ancient_item), and all positively-received books. ...Which is all books when it comes to her preferences.
She has a line for loved birthday gifts, liked-and-neutral birthday gifts, and disliked-and-hated birthday gifts. That last one kind of goes harsh...
