/*Vanilla Abigail already has lines for the Parrot Egg trinket, Emerald, Aquamarine, Ruby, Amethyst, Topaz, and Jade.
Coincidentally, they're exactly the kind of lines I wanted to write for her, which makes me think I have a good handle on
her character. Actually, the gems ones are pretty elaborate, being 50/50 odds of choosing between two different lines.*/
