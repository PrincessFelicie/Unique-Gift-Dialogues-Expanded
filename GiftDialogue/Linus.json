/*Vanilla Linus has a line for The Alleyway Buffet, all positively-received forage food, Wild Bait, Treasure Chest, and all positively-received fish.
Same as with Gus, when I first started working on this mod, Linus's reaction to liked forage food applied to *all* forage instead, regardless of edibility.
He has no lines for birthday presents.
