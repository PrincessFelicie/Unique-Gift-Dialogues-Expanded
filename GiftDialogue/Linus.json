/*Vanilla Linus has a line for The Alleyway Buffet, all positively-received forage items, Wild Bait, Treasure Chest, and all positively-received fish.
Same as with Gus, when I first started working on this mod, Linus's reaction to liked forage applied to *all* forage instead, regardless of whether he liked it. Even with that fixed, there's still the issue that that line talks about *eating* it, which isn't great for poisonous forage.
He has no lines for birthday presents.
